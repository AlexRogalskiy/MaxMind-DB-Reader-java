CHANGELOG
=========

1.0.1 (2015-12-17)
------------------

* Several optimizations have been made to reduce allocations when decoding a
  record. Pull requests by Viktor Szathm√°ry. GitHub #16 & #17.


1.0.0 (2014-09-29)
------------------

* First production release.

0.4.0 (2014-09-23)
------------------

* Made `com.maxmind.db.Metadata` public and added public getters for most
  of the interesting metadata. This is accessible through the `getMetadata()`
  method on a `Reader` object.

0.3.4 (2014-08-27)
------------------

* Previously the Reader would hold onto the underlying file and FileChannel,
  not closing them until the Reader was closed. This was unnecessary; they
  are now closed immediately after they are used. Fix by Andrew Snare; GitHub
  issue #7.
* The Reader now discards the reference to the underlying buffer when
  `close()` is called. This is done to help ensure that the buffer is garbage
  collected sooner, which may mitigate file locking issues that some users
  have experienced on Windows when updating the database. Patch by Andrew
  Snare; GitHub issue #8.

0.3.3 (2014-06-02)
------------------

* A potential (small) resource leak when using this library with a thread
  pool was fixed.

0.3.2 (2014-04-02)
------------------

* Added tests and documentation for multi-threaded use.

0.3.1 (2013-11-05)
------------------

* An `InputStream` constructor was added to the `Reader` class. This reads the
  stream into memory as if it was using `FileMode.MEMORY`. Patch by Matthew
  Daniel.
* The source code is now attached during packaging. Patch by Matthew Daniel.
* The artifact ID was changed to `maxmind-db` in order to increase naming
  consistency.

0.3.0 (2013-10-17)
------------------

* IMPORTANT: The package name was changed to `com.maxmind.db`. The
  `MaxMindDbReader` class was renamed to `Reader`.
* Improved error handling and test coverage.
* Performance improvements.

0.2.0 (2013-07-08)
------------------

* The reader and database format now uses IEEE 754 doubles and floats.
* FileMode.IN_MEMORY was renamed to FileMode.MEMORY.
* Cache Type enum values array.

0.1.0 (2013-06-14)
------------------

* Initial release
